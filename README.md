Portfolio Website Trial with Github Pages

This way should replace the original idea of hosting a server and buying a domain --> Might have been
Overkill for a Portfolio Website.

First Draft was to only have a Homepage

Additional Idea have been in splitting the different sections into different html files and then transition between 
them instead of loading.

Missing context, will add later.
